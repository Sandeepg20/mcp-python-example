# MCP Server in Python – Example

This repository demonstrates a minimal **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server
implemented in Python.

It shows how deterministic business logic or workflow rules can be exposed
as **AI-native tools** that AI agents can discover and use autonomously.

## What’s Included
- A minimal MCP server
- A sample business-rule tool (eligibility check)
- Clear separation of server and tools

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- pip

## Install
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
